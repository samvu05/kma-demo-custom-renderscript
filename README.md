# Demo Custom RenderScript
- A simple simulation application for chapter "Render Script" in "Mobile Software Optimization" subjects.
- Demonstrates how to create a custom .RS scipt file and compare performance with traditional method.

## About RenderScript
- RenderScript is a framework for running computationally intensive tasks at high performance on Android. 
RenderScript is primarily oriented for use with data-parallel computation, although serial computationally intensive workloads can benefit as well.

- RenderScript intrinsics are built-in functions that perform well-defined operations often seen in image processing. 
Intrinsics provide extremely high-performance implementations of standard functions with a minimal amount of code.

## Used Tech
- Kotlin
- Android
